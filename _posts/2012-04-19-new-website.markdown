Hi everyone! you may have noticed that there have been some changes made to the website. Earlier this week I pushed out a brand new design that gives the site a more bloggish feel. My goal is to regularly update the site with fresh content including station news, album reviews, photos, and more. 

Geneseo sports a small, but vibrant music scene. The site will also feature photos, videos and articles regarding all of the great student bands on campus.

If you have anything you would like to get published on the site, whether it be an article or photos, email me at [hps1@geneseo.edu] [email] and we can work on getting it on the site. When I say anything, I really mean it. The more content, from the more contributors, the better.

Thanks! 

Herb
